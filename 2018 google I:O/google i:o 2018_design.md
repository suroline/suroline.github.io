## Session: Best practices to design AR applications (Google I/O '18)
- 5 Pillars of AR Design
    - 1. Understand the user's environment
    - 2. Plan for AR Design
    - 3. Onboard users by initializing smoothly
    - 4. Design natural object interactions
    - 5. Balance on screen and volunetric interface design
        - Consider Scale : table scale, room scale, world scale (unlimited)
        - Utility application should let you rotate and move so can be reached data easily
        - Understanding depth requires movement
        - Decide if users will be able to easily move AR objects after placement, or if they are persistent
        - Object interaction: Feedback on collision, surface feedback, maintain height until the user lets go, Visually indicate the drop point, Provide feedback on placement, Reticle selection, Virtual weights
        - Only use screen surface UI for cotrols with a high frequency of use, controls that require fast access 
        - try to maintain finger sized touch targets on objects
* Scene over screen

## Session: Challenges and learnings of building for the next billion users (Google I/O '18)
- Accessible & familiar
- Available in different contexts
- Leverages different modalities

- Multimodal Spectrum
    - Voice only: AI speaker > Natural > great for hands-free, far-field, reduces navigation, 
    - Voice forawrd: Car, Pad > 
    - Intermodal: Phone, PC
    - Visual only: Watch 

- Voice vs Visual both have there own benefit
    - Voice forward and intermodal is the best.

- How to design them? Start with a human conversation
